## Introduction
Using the `Flask API` in conjunction with `HTML`,`Javascript`, and `CSS`, we created an interactive interface where users can specify dates to display the results of the analysis. Through the use of `PGAdmin` and `SQL`, we created a database to house the data and used the Flask API to fetch and run the analysis while using Javascript to create the visualizations. 

To access the local Flask API, simply run the `app.py` file from the terminal.
